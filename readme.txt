!! README !! LOVELYZ WEBSITE !! CSC104 !!

There are different CSS files for the different pages created.
We only needed to really code 3 pages for our sites, so the main focus will
be the homepage, events, and info. Shop will be too difficult for me right now, and contact
was a simple setup that I felt is just better for the extra :)

Homepage - (1/3)
lovelyzhome.html
lovelyzcss.css

The Homepage explains the website to the viewers. It's like a little inspirational
article of how LovelyZ began. It will also help guide viewers through the site.

Shop - 
lovelyzshop.html

The shop will be all about the LovelyZ Shop, I am not going to have this included
in the assignment, however if curious what I am talking about, this idea for a site 
is all because of my love for cars. I started a brand called LovelyZ.
lovelyzshop.com is the real thing. So it would basically take that and put it here :)

*sidenote: this is just extra page, but if I made this real I would put the shop here

Events - (2/3)
lovelyzevents.html
lovelyzeventscss.css

The events tab shows all events around the world, this gives car people the most updated events. It will lead
to the events offcial site so they can have more infomation or purchase tickets if nessessary. I thought
this would be an amazing idea for the car people who want to attend events, but may not know where to go!

Info - (3/3)
lovelyzinfo.html
lovelyzinfocss.css

The info tab is pretty much little articles where I get to talk about car related topics. It can be a good
learning/inspirational experience for the viewers.

Contact - 
lovelyzcontact.html
lovelyzcontactcss.css

We always need a way to contact :) This way if there's any issues or maybe they have ideas for topics or events,
we can always add them/would love to hear them.
