<!-- I got a little extra help from https://www.w3schools.com ,but didn't want to use it too much, however it was helpful for some simple wonderings I had for things to do for my website :) and then of course what we learned in class! Hopefully I did well!-->

                        This is a website created for my CSC104 class. Our project was to make a website with a at least 3 pages completed for our topic and at least 3 subcategories. I chose my topic to be about cars! I started a brand this year called LovelyZ. It is my cars Instagram handle, so I made it my brand because I wanted to start selling products. That is why this is called "LovelyZ Talk". Here on this website you can see my shop. You can also view car events all over the world! The info tab is where I post small articles about fun topics to talk about. This website can be inspirational and also helpful. I created a contact page as well for anyone to leave feedback or if there's any questions or concerns with the site, please contact.
