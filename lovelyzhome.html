                    <ul>
                        This is a website created for my CSC104 class. Our project was to make a website with a at least 3 pages completed for our topic and at least 3 subcategories. I chose my topic to be about cars! I started a brand this year called LovelyZ. It is my cars Instagram handle, so I made it my brand because I wanted to start selling products. That is why this is called "LovelyZ Talk". Here on this website you can see my shop. You can also view car events all over the world! The info tab is where I post small articles about fun topics to talk about. This website can be inspirational and also helpful. I created a contact page as well for anyone to leave feedback or if there's any questions or concerns with the site, please contact.

                <h3>Why get into cars?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        Do you ever think of getting into cars or maybe you already have some interest in the car scene and want more information. Here I will give you more information about the car scene, this is a positive friendly environment here. I, LovelyZ, grew up around cars from my dad. He showed me car related movies, which led me to love the Nissan Skyline GT-R34. This is a very popular car, it was my dream car up until I got a car and was really understanding cars more. It may not be my dream car anymore, but Nissan stays my favorite. We all find a style we love with cars and we will talk more about that here for you to get ideas of what you like. My first car was a 8th generation Honda Civic. It was a nice car, however, I fell in love with the Nissan 350z and was very determined to get one. When I did, I felt a lot of love for it. Getting inside the car felt amazing, it felt like it was for me. That's how it should feel when you find a car you like. I'm sure you know the feeling I'm talking about. The car community has good and bad parts. However, I have made friends and met some really cool people through the car scene and it's been nothing but good.
